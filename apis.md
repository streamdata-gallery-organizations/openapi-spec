description: 'The Open API Initiative (OAI) was created by a consortium of forward-looking
  industry experts who recognize the immense value of standardizing on how REST APIs
  are described. As an open governance structure under the Linux Foundation, the OAI
  is focused on creating, evolving and promoting a vendor neutral description format.
  SmartBear Software is donating the Swagger Specification directly to the OAI as
  the basis of this Open Specification. '
